# Bootstrap Tumblr Theme

*What*: A Tumblr theme built on top of Twitter's Bootstrap framework.

*Why*: To minimize the effort required to maintain consistent designs on both a Bootstrap-based web app and its corresponding Tumblr blog.

*How*: Borrowed the overall structure from the awesome Royal Ribbon theme, and rebuilt it using Bootstrap markup and styles.


## Details

This theme provides a very basic and barebones framework within which to apply your own styles.  Typically this involves linking to your web app's existing stylesheet, then applying further custom CSS to polish off the integration with Tumblr.

By default this theme uses Bootstrap's responsive styles, so it should look sexy across devices and form factors.  Of course the devil is in the details, so be sure to tweak for your needs.


## Usage

For now, simply upload bootstrap-tumblr-theme.html in its entirety to the HTML customization area of your Tumblr customization page:

* ``http://www.tumblr.com/customize/<your-blog>``
* Click ``Edit HTML``
* Paste the theme's HTML and Save
* Link to your web app's stylesheet (search the markup for ``example.com``)
* Tweak to your satisfaction using familiar Bootstrap styles and structure
* Save and start posting!


## Roadmap

* release as a theme within Tumblr's theme gallery
* make it better&#8482;
